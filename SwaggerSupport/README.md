# Swagger Support

I followed the instructions in following article to create a visual studio project to learn swagger support

- [ASP.NET Core Web API help pages with Swagger / Open API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/web-api-help-pages-using-swagger?view=aspnetcore-2.1)

If you had followed this article in the past, you can compare your learning with mine.  I created the project as following
- Visual Studio 2017
- **File** -> **New** -> **Project** -> **Visual C#** -> **Web** > **ASP.NET Core Web Application**
- Set name of the project to **VsToolsForDocker**
- Select **API** template
- Select **Enable Docker Support**
- Unselect **HTTPS**

## What did I learn?
